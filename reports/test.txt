Upon my arrival, I contacted Sylvia. Sylvia is 89 years old and lives with her
disabled, adult son at the above address.
               
Sylvia stated that several days ago (Possibly Mon or Tues) she noticed that her
jewelry box was missing from her bedroom.
               
There was no forced entry to the home.
               
Sylvia stated that her son often goes for long walks in the morning and
afternoon. He walks the span from Lincoln Park to Alki.
               
When her son leaves the house for his walks, he does not lock the doors. The
house is often unlocked and unoccupied for several hours each day.
               
Sylvia stated that She noticed her jewelry box missing on Wed of this week.
The jewelry box sat on top of her dresser in her bedroom. The box was made of
wood (oak or maple) and was approximately 16" tall and 12" wide.
               
The jewelry box contained multiple necklace chains and her wedding ring set.
               
Sylvia stated that she was also missing a pair of gold and pearl earrings.
               
Sylvia described her wedding ring as a double gold band with a slider clasp to
adjust the size of the band.  She stated that the band adjustment slider is
rare and specific to her ring. She stated that she has arthritic hands and had
this feature added to the ring so she could continue to wear the ring over her
knuckles.
               
The wedding ring stone was a round diamond of an unknown size. Sylvia stated
that it was a good sized stone, but she did not know the carat weight.  The
center diamond was surrounded by about four smaller, round diamonds.
               
Sylvia stated that she contacted her insurance company today and was notified
that her deductible was $4500. Sylvia did not believe that the amount of stolen
jewelry amounted to the insurance deductible.
               
I contacted Sylvia's neighbors who have a decent line of sight to her home.
Sylvia's neighbor works from home, but was not at home Mon or Tues and did not
see any suspicious activity.
               
Sylvia was left with an SPD business card, case number and follow up form.
